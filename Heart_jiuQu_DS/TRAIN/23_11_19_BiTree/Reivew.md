- 09:00 Understand the `create_tree.c` file
    - Find out that the file use preorder output and logic to create the tree. Than I wonder whether we could use inorder or postorder outputs and logic to do that.
    - 10:18 I tried and produce 2 files like `create_tree_in_false.c` and `create_tree_post_false.c`, as you can see, all false. Cause we could **only create a root node at the first** and then link the other nodes on it. left-root-right or left-right-root both create the leftest node at first which i think can't make sense.
    - 10:20 Want to write a program like output a tree in [[Bitree.md]], butnot now.
    - 10:30 MISSION COMPLETED: understand how to create a binary tree Using 1h30mins
